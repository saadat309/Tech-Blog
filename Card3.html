              skin tissue grants robots special properties and abilities</h2>
            <hr>
            <img src="Pics/AI & human.jpg" class="img-fluid mb-4" alt="Robots face the future">
            <p class="fs-5">AResearchers have found a way to bind engineered skin tissue to the complex forms of
              humanoid robots. This brings with it potential benefits to robotic platforms such as increased mobility,
              self-healing abilities, embedded sensing capabilities and an increasingly lifelike appearance. Taking
              inspiration from human skin ligaments, the team, led by Professor Shoji Takeuchi of the University of
              Tokyo, included special perforations in a robot face, which helped a layer of skin take hold. Their
              research could be useful in the cosmetics industry and to help train plastic surgeons.

              Takeuchi is a pioneer in the field of biohybrid robotics, where biology and mechanical engineering meet.
              So far, his lab, the Biohybrid Systems Laboratory, has created mini robots that walk using biological
              muscle tissue, 3D printed lab-grown meat, engineered skin that can heal, and more. It was during research
              on the last of these items that Takeuchi felt the need to take the idea of robotic skin further to improve
              its properties and capabilities.</p>
            <p class="fs-5">"During previous research on a finger-shaped robot covered in engineered skin tissue we grew
              in our lab, I felt the need for better adhesion between the robotic features and the subcutaneous
              structure of the skin," said Takeuchi. "By mimicking human skin-ligament structures and by using specially
              made V-shaped perforations in solid materials, we found a way to bind skin to complex structures. The
              natural flexibility of the skin and the strong method of adhesion mean the skin can move with the
              mechanical components of the robot without tearing or peeling away."

              Previous methods to attach skin tissue to solid surfaces involved things like mini anchors or hooks, but
              these limited the kinds of surfaces that could receive skin coatings and could cause damage during motion.
              By carefully engineering small perforations instead, essentially any shape of surface can have skin
              applied to it. The trick the team employed was to use a special collagen gel for adhesion, which is
              naturally viscous so difficult to feed into the minuscule perforations. But using a common technique for
              plastic adhesion called plasma treatment, they managed to coax the collagen into the fine structures of
              the perforations while also holding the skin close to the surface in question.</p>
            <p class="fs-5">"Manipulating soft, wet biological tissues during the development process is much harder
              than people outside the field might think. For instance, if sterility is not maintained, bacteria can
              enter and the tissue will die," said Takeuchi. "However, now that we can do this, living skin can bring a
              range of new abilities to robots. Self-healing is a big deal -- some chemical-based materials can be made
              to heal themselves, but they require triggers such as heat, pressure or other signals, and they also do
              not proliferate like cells. Biological skin repairs minor lacerations as ours does, and nerves and other
              skin organs can be added for use in sensing and so on."

              This research was not just made to prove a point, though. Takeuchi and his lab have a goal in mind for
              this application that could help in several areas of medical research. The idea of an organ-on-a-chip is
              not especially new, and finds use in things like drug development, but something like a face-on-a-chip
              could be useful in research into skin aging, cosmetics, surgical procedures, plastic surgery and more.
              Also, if sensors can be embedded, robots may be endowed with better environmental awareness and improved
              interactive capabilities.</p>
            <p class="fs-5">"In this study, we managed to replicate human appearance to some extent by creating a face
              with the same surface material and structure as humans," said Takeuchi. "Additionally, through this
              research, we identified new challenges, such as the necessity for surface wrinkles and a thicker epidermis
              to achieve a more humanlike appearance. We believe that creating a thicker and more realistic skin can be
              achieved by incorporating sweat glands, sebaceous glands, pores, blood vessels, fat and nerves. Of course,
              movement is also a crucial factor, not just the material, so another important challenge is creating
              humanlike expressions by integrating sophisticated actuators, or muscles, inside the robot. Creating
              robots that can heal themselves, sense their environment more accurately and perform tasks with humanlike
              dexterity is incredibly motivating."</p>

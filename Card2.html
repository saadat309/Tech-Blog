            <h2 class="mb-4 text-capitalize" style="color: #a48dce;">Meet CARMEN, a robot that helps people with mild
              cognitive impairment</h2>
            <hr>
            <img src="Pics/Ai in medicine.jpg" class="img-fluid mb-4" alt="Meet CARMEN">
            <p class="fs-5">Meet CARMEN, short for Cognitively Assistive Robot for Motivation and Neurorehabilitation-a
              small, tabletop robot designed to help people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) learn skills to improve
              memory, attention, and executive functioning at home.

              Unlike other robots in this space, CARMEN was developed by the research team at the University of
              California San Diego in collaboration with clinicians, people with MCI, and their care partners. To the
              best of the researchers' knowledge, CARMEN is also the only robot that teaches compensatory cognitive
              strategies to help improve memory and executive function.</p>
            <p class="fs-5">"We wanted to make sure we were providing meaningful and practical inventions," said Laurel
              Riek, a professor of computer science and emergency medicine at UC San Diego and the work's senior author.

              MCI is an in-between stage between typical aging and dementia. It affects various areas of cognitive
              functioning, including memory, attention, and executive functioning. About 20% of individuals over 65 have
              the condition, with up to 15% transitioning to dementia each year. Existing pharmacological treatments
              have not been able to slow or prevent this evolution, but behavioral treatments can help.

              Researchers programmed CARMEN to deliver a series of simple cognitive training exercises. For example, the
              robot can teach participants to create routine places to leave important objects, such as keys; or learn
              note taking strategies to remember important things. CARMEN does this through interactive games and
              activities.</p>
            <p class="fs-5">The research team designed CARMEN with a clear set of criteria in mind. It is important that
              people can use the robot independently, without clinician or researcher supervision. For this reason,
              CARMEN had to be plug and play, without many moving parts that require maintenance. The robot also has to
              be able to function with limited access to the internet, as many people do not have access to reliable
              connectivity. CARMEN needs to be able to function over a long period of time. The robot also has to be
              able to communicate clearly with users; express compassion and empathy for a person's situation; and
              provide breaks after challenging tasks to help sustain engagement.

              Researchers deployed CARMEN for a week in the homes of several people with MCI, who then engaged in
              multiple tasks with the robot, such as identifying routine places to leave household items so they don't
              get lost, and placing tasks on a calendar so they won't be forgotten. Researchers also deployed the robot
              in the homes of several clinicians with experience working with people with MCI. Both groups of
              participants completed questionnaires and interviews before and after the week-long deployments.</p>
            <p class="fs-5">After the week with CARMEN, participants with MCI reported trying strategies and behaviors
              that they previously had written off as impossible. All participants reported that using the robot was
              easy. Two out of the three participants found the activities easy to understand, but one of the users
              struggled. All said they wanted more interaction with the robot.

              "We found that CARMEN gave participants confidence to use cognitive strategies in their everyday life, and
              participants saw opportunities for CARMEN to exhibit greater levels of autonomy or be used for other
              applications," the researchers write.

              The research team presented their findings at the ACM/IEEE Human Robot Interaction (HRI) conference in
              March 2024, where they received a best paper award nomination.</p>
            <h4>Next steps</h4>
            <p class="fs-5">Next steps include deploying the robot in a larger number of homes.

              Researchers also plan to give CARMEN the ability to have conversations with users, with an emphasis on
              preserving privacy when these conversations happen. This is both an accessibility issue (as some users
              might not have the fine motor skills necessary to interact with CARMEN's touch screen), as well as because
              most people expect to be able to have conversations with systems in their homes. At the same time,
              researchers want to limit how much information CARMEN can give users. "We want to be mindful that the user
              still needs to do the bulk of the work, so the robot can only assist and not give too many hints," Riek
              said.</p>
            <p class="fs-5">Researchers are also exploring how CARMEN could assist users with other conditions, such as
              ADHD.

              The UC San Diego team built CARMEN based on the FLEXI robot from the University of Washington. But they
              made substantial changes to its hardware, and wrote all its software from scratch. Researchers used ROS
              for the robot's operating system.
